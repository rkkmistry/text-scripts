#Krishan's Super Fun Text Scripts
All of these scripts are pretty simple python scripts that I've been using to mess around with text generation and speed up my poetic process. All of them are run in the terminal and take in files in .txt format. Each script has a comment at the top that gives more detailed instructions on how to run them and what inputs/parameters they take, but below you can find a very high level description of them.

**jupymarkov.py** - uses ngrams to generate text statistically similar to the text inputted

**poslist.py** - prints out a lists of unique words in the file ordered by part of speech 

**posswap.py** - takes two texts and swaps all the parts of speech in one for a certain part of speech in the other

**shuffle.py** - takes two texts and randomly selects lines from each to create a new text

**possplit.py** - inserts a line break at a specified part of speech

I agree with the Court that In re Seagate Technology, LLC, , takes too mechanical an approach to the award of enhanced damages. But, as the Court notes, the relevant statutory provision, 35 U.S.C. §284, nonetheless imposes limits that help produce uniformity in its application and maintain its consistency with the basic objectives of patent law. See U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 8 . I write separately to express my own understanding of several of those limits.

First, the Court's references to "willful misconduct" do not mean that a court may award enhanced damages simply because the evidence shows that the infringer knew about the patent and nothing more. Ante, at 11. "'[W]illfu[l]' is a 'word of many meanings whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears.'" Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr. Here, the Court's opinion, read as a whole and in context, explains that "enhanced damages are generally appropriate . . . only in egregious cases." Ante, at 8-9 ; ante, at 11 (Enhanced damages "should generally be reserved for egregious cases typified by willful misconduct" . They amount to a "'punitive'" sanction for engaging in conduct that is either "deliberate" or "wanton." Ante, at 8; compare Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co. 1964 Dec. Comm'r Pat. and Seymour v. McCormick , with ante, at 10-11, and n. by way of example, to a "'wanton and malicious pirate' who intentionally infringes another's patent--with no doubts about its validity or any notion of a defense--for no purpose other than to steal the patentee's business." Ante, at 9. And while the Court explains that "intentional or knowing" infringement "may" warrant a punitive sanction, the word it uses is may, not must. Ante, at 10. It is "circumstanc[e]" that transforms simple knowledge into such egregious behavior, and that makes all the difference. Ante, at 11.

Second, the Court writes against a statutory background specifying that the "failure of an infringer to obtain the advice of counsel . . . may not be used to prove that the accused infringer wilfully infringed." §298. The Court does not weaken this rule through its interpretation of §284. Nor should it. It may well be expensive to obtain an opinion of counsel. See Brief for Public Knowledge et al. as Amici Curiae 9 ; Brief for Internet Companies as Amici Curiae 13 . Such costs can prevent an innovator from getting a small business up and running. At the same time, an owner of a small firm, or a scientist, engineer, or technician working there, might, without being "wanton" or "reckless," reasonably determine that its product does not infringe a particular patent, or that that patent is probably invalid. Cf. Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., ___, . I do not say that a lawyer's informed opinion would be unhelpful. To the contrary, consulting counsel may help draw the line between infringing and noninfringing uses. But on the other side of the equation lie the costs and the consequent risk of discouraging lawful innovation. Congress has thus left it to the potential infringer to decide whether to consult counsel--without the threat of treble damages influencing that decision. That is, Congress has determined that where both "advice of counsel" and "increased damages" are at issue, insisting upon the legal game is not worth the candle. Compare §298 with §284.

Third, as the Court explains, enhanced damages may not "serve to compensate patentees" for infringement-related costs or litigation expenses. Ante, at 3-4. That is because §284 provides for the former prior to any enhancement. §284 ; see ante, at 4. And a different statutory provision, §285, provides for the latter. Ibid.; Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., .

I describe these limitations on enhanced damages awards for a reason. Patent infringement, of course, is a highly undesirable and unlawful activity. But stopping infringement is a means to patent law's ends. Through a complex system of incentive-based laws, patent law helps to encourage the development of, disseminate knowledge about, and permit others to benefit from useful inventions. Enhanced damages have a role to play in achieving those objectives, but, as described above, that role is limited.

Consider that the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office estimates that more than 2,500,000 patents are currently in force. See Dept. of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, A. Marco, M. Carley, S. Jackson, & A. Myers, The USPTO Historical Patent Files: Two Centuries of Invention, No p fig. Members of the Court have noted that some "firms use patents . . . primarily obtai[n] licensing fees." eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C. . Amici explain that some of those firms generate revenue by sending letters to "'tens of thousands of people asking for a license or settlement'" on a patent "'that may in fact not be warranted.'" Brief for Internet Companies as Amici Curiae 12; cf. Letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper , in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 295 . How is a growing business to react to the arrival of such a letter, particularly if that letter carries with it a serious risk of treble damages? Does the letter put the company "on notice" of the patent? Will a jury find that the company behaved "recklessly," simply for failing to spend considerable time, effort, and money obtaining expert views about whether some or all of the patents described in the letter apply to its activities ? These investigative activities can be costly. Hence, the risk of treble damages can encourage the company to settle, or even abandon any challenged activity.

To say this is to point to a risk: The more that businesses, laboratories, hospitals, and individuals adopt this approach, the more often a patent will reach beyond its lawful scope to discourage lawful activity, and the more often patent-related demands will frustrate, rather than "promote," the "Progress of Science and useful Arts." U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 8; see, e.g., Eon-Net LP v. Flagstar Bancorp, 1327 ; In re MPHJ Technology Invs., LLC, 1007-1012 ; Brief for Internet Companies as Amici Curiae 15 ; Brief for Public Knowledge et al. as Amici Curiae in the context of enhanced damages, there are patent-related risks on both sides of the equation. That fact argues, not for abandonment of enhanced damages, but for their careful application, to ensure that they only target cases of egregious misconduct.

One final point: The Court holds that awards of enhanced damages should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Ante, at 12-13. I agree. But I also believe that, in applying that standard, the Federal Circuit may take advantage of its own experience and expertise in patent law. Whether, for example, an infringer truly had "no doubts about validity" of a patent may require an assessment of the reasonableness of a defense that may be apparent from the face of that patent. See ante, at 9. And any error on such a question would be an abuse of discretion. Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System, Inc., ___, n. 2, ("A district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law" .

In this case, a jury returned a legally impermissible verdict. The trial judge did not realize the error until shortly after he excused the jury. He brought the jury back and ordered them to deliberate again to correct the mistake. The question before us is whether a federal district court can recall a jury it has discharged, or whether the court can remedy the error only by ordering a new trial.

This Court now holds that a federal district court has the inherent power to rescind a jury discharge order and recall a jury for further deliberations after identifying an error in the jury's verdict. Because the potential of tainting jurors and the jury process after discharge is extraordinarily high, however, this power is limited in duration and scope, and must be exercised carefully to avoid any potential prejudice.

I

Petitioner Rocky Dietz was driving through an intersection in Bozeman, Montana, when Hillary Bouldin ran the red light and T-boned Dietz. As a result of the accident, Dietz suffered injuries to his lower back that caused him severe pain. He sought physical therapy, steroid injections, and other medications to treat his pain. Dietz sued Bouldin for negligence. Bouldin removed the case to Federal District Court. See 28 U. S. C. §§1332

At trial, Bouldin admitted that he was at fault for the accident and that Dietz was injured as a result. Bouldin also stipulated that Dietz' medical expenses of $10,136 were reasonable and necessary as a result of the collision. The only disputed issue at trial for the jury to resolve was whether Dietz was entitled to damages above $10,136.

During deliberations, the jury sent the judge a note asking: "'Has the $10,136 medical expenses been paid; and if so, by whom?'" App The court discussed the note with the parties' attorneys and told them he was unsure whether the jurors understood that their verdict could not be less than that stipulated amount, and that a mistrial would be required if the jury did not return a verdict of at least $10,136. The judge, however, with the consent of both parties, told the jury that the information they sought was not relevant to the verdict.

The jury returned a verdict in Dietz' favor but awarded him $0 in damages. The judge thanked the jury for its service and ordered them "discharged," telling the jurors they were "free to go." App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a. The jurors gathered their things and left the courtroom.

A few minutes later, the court ordered the clerk to bring the jurors back. Speaking with counsel outside the jury's presence, the court explained that it had "just stopped the jury from leaving the building," after realizing that the $0 verdict was not "legally possible in view of stipulated damages exceeding $10,000." Id., at 26a. The court suggested two alternatives: order a new trial or reempanel the jurors, instructing them to award at least the stipulated damages, and ordering them to deliberate anew.
 Dietz' attorney objected to reempaneling the discharged jurors, arguing that the jury was no longer capable of returning a fair and impartial verdict. The court reiterated that none of the jurors had left the building, and asked the clerk whether any had even left the floor where the courtroom was located. The clerk explained that only one juror had left the building to get a hotel receipt and bring it back.

Before the jurors returned, the judge told the parties that he planned to order the jury to deliberate again and reach a different verdict. The judge explained that he would "hate to just throw away the money and time that's been expended in this trial." Id., at 28a. When the jurors returned to the courtroom, the judge questioned them as a group and confirmed that they had not spoken to anyone about the case.

The judge explained to the jurors the mistake in not awarding the stipulated damages. He informed the jurors that he was reempaneling them and would ask them to start over with clarifying instructions. He asked the jurors to confirm that they understood their duty and to return the next morning to deliberate anew. The next day, the reassembled jury returned a verdict awarding Dietz $15,000 in damages.

On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed.. The court held that a district court could reempanel the jury shortly after dismissal as long as during the period of dismissal, the jurors were not exposed to any outside influences that would compromise their ability to reconsider the verdict fairly. This Court granted Dietz' petition for a writ of certiorari to resolve confusion in the Courts of Appeals on whether and when a federal district court has the authority to recall a jury after discharging it. . See Wagner v. Jones, 1034-1035 , cert. denied, ; United States v. Figueroa, 72-73 ; United States v. Rojas, 677-678 ; United States v. Marinari, 1214 ; Summers v. United States, 585-587 .

 ERISA does not guarantee substantive benefits. The statute, instead, seeks to make the benefits promised by an employer more secure by mandating certain oversight systems and other standard procedures. Travelers, at 651, Those systems and procedures are intended to be uniform. Id., at 656,(ERISA's pre-emption clause "indicates Congress's intent to establish the regulation of employee welfare benefit plans 'as exclusively a federal concern'" (quoting Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc.. "Requiring ERISA administrators to master the relevant laws of 50 States and to contend with litigation would undermine the congressional goal of 'minimiz the administrative and financial burden[s]' on plan administrators--burdens ultimately borne by the beneficiaries." Egelhoff, supra, at 149-150,(quoting Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon; see also Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 9,.
 ERISA's reporting, disclosure, and recordkeeping requirements for welfare benefit plans are extensive. ERISA plans must present participants with a plan description explaining, among other things, the plan's eligibility requirements and claims-processing procedures. §§1021 1024. Plans must notify participants when a claim is denied and state the basis for the denial. §1133. Most important for the pre-emption question presented here, welfare benefit plans governed by ERISA must file an annual report with the Secretary of Labor. The report must include a financial statement listing assets and liabilities for the previous year and, further, receipts and disbursements of funds. §§1021 1023- The information on assets and liabilities as well as receipts and disbursements must be provided to plan participants on an annual basis as well. §§1021, 1023- Because welfare benefit plans are in the business of providing benefits to plan participants, a plan's reporting of data on disbursements by definition incorporates paid claims. See Dept. of Labor, Schedule H Financial Information , online at http://www. dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/2015-5500-Schedule-H.pdf .
 The Secretary of Labor has authority to establish additional reporting and disclosure requirements for ERISA plans. ERISA permits the Secretary to use the data disclosed by plans "for statistical and research purposes, and compile and publish such studies, analyses, reports, and surveys based thereon as he may deem appropriate." §1026. The Secretary also may, "in connection" with any research, "collect, compile, analyze, and publish data, information, and statistics relating to" plans. §1143; see also §1143 .

ERISA further permits the Secretary of Labor to "requir[e] any information or data from any where he finds such data or information is necessary to carry out the purposes of" the statute, §1024, and, when investigating a possible statutory violation, "to require the submission of reports, books, and records, and the filing of data" related to other requisite filings, §1134. The Secretary has the general power to promulgate regulations "necessary or appropriate" to administer the statute, §1135, and to provide exemptions from any reporting obligations, §1024.

It should come as no surprise, then, that plans must keep detailed records so compliance with ERISA's reporting and disclosure requirements may be "verified, explained, or clarified, and checked for accuracy and completeness." §1027. The records to be retained must "include vouchers, worksheets, receipts, and applicable resolutions." Ibid.; see also §1135 .
 These various requirements are not mere formalities. Violation of any one of them may result in both civil and criminal liability. See §§1131-1132.

As all this makes plain, reporting, disclosure, and record keeping are central to, and an essential part of, the uniform system of plan administration contemplated by ERISA. The Court, in fact, has noted often that these requirements are integral aspects of ERISA. See, e.g., Dillingham, at 327, Travelers, supra, at 651, Ingersoll-Rand, supra, at 137, Massachusetts v. Morash 115,; Fort Halifax, supra, at 9, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts.
